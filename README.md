# Predicting-bike-sharing-demang-neural-network

In this project, I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I had a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before moving to higher level tools such as PyTorch.

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the cnt column.
